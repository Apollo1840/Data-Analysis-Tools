# Data-Analysis-Tools

This repository contains three main topics:

/>    Instruction of the existing tools. 
  
/>    The dummy project I did.
  
/>    The new tools I made. (the most valuable part)

## 1, Instruction of the existing tools.

* Filename starts with 'learn_'.

There are scripts teaching you how to use data analysis and visualization tools like pandas, matplotlib, pyecharts...  This part contains the tutorial material I made as well as some resource on the internet.

## 2, The dummy project I did.

* Filename starts with 'proj_'.

Those projects are either made-up projects or the project owned by me. It is the demonstration of how to use those tools in practical cases. 

mark: most of the py file cannot be complied correctly because I haven't provided the data file.

## 3, The new tools I made.

* Filename starts with 'DAT_'.

Those data-analysis tools are designed based on existed tools. I use them to simplify some task during the data analysis process.

mark: the DATs based on pandas are predecessors of library Bamboo, which is currently not published useful data-analysis tool.

mark: Project Athena will need some classes and functions from this repository.
