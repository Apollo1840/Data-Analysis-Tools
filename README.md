## Theory
### 0, how to do data analysis

> Preparation -> Preporcessing -> analysis -> posprocessing

To my understanding is : 

#### 1) Be clear of needs.

This is the most valuable and always been underestimate.

#### 2) Get data. 

This is not only be DB, but also activities to acctual get the data from world and also generate the feature.

We need know how to cooperate with DBs and how to use pandas to generate feature (after step 3)

#### 3) clean data.

it is also called data wrangling.

#### 4) analysis.

Here is where pandas plays and also ML techs.

#### 5) report. 

For this we need varies of data visualization skills.

## Some experience

- Do researches on the topic, know the data by heart, use as much human knowledge as possible.
- Notice the outlier
