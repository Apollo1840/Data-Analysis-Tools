# Data-Analysis-Tools

This repository contains three main topics:

### 1, Instruction of the existing tools. 

### 2, The dummy project I did.

### 3, The new tools I made. (the most valuable part)


## 1, Instruction of the existing tools.
In first section, the file name starts with 'learn_', there are scripts teaching you how to use data-analysis and visualization tools like pandas, matplotlib, pyecharts...  This part contains the tutorial material I made as well as some resource on the internet.

## 2, The dummy project I did.
The file name starts with 'proj_'. Those projects are either made-up projects or the project owned by me. It is the demonstration of how to use those tools in pratical cases.

## 3, The new tools I made.
Those data-analysis tools, whose name starts with 'DAT_' is designed based on existed tools. I use them to implify some task during the data analysis process.

mark: the DATs based on pandas are predecessors of library Bamboo, which is currently not published usefull data-analysis tool.

mark: Project Athena will needs some classes and functions from this repository.

# Project Athena: 
AI-based automative data analysis tool which acts like a experienced data scientist, tells you import facts in the dataframe, interact with you to make conclusions and predictions.
