# Data-Analysis-Tools

This repository contains three main topics:

   0, How to do data analysis.
   
   1, Instruction of the existing tools. 
  
   2, The dummy project I did.
  
   3, The new tools I made. **(the most valuable part)**

## 0, how to do data analysis

Theorically is : Preparation - Preporcessing - analysis - posprocessing

To my understanding is : 

#### 1) Be clear of needs.

This is the most valuable and always been underestimate.

#### 2) Get data. 

This is not only be DB, but also activities to acctual get the data from world and also generate the feature.

We need know how to cooperate with DBs and how to use pandas to generate feature (after step 3)

#### 3) clean data.

it is also called data wrangling.

#### 4) analysis.

Here is where pandas plays and also ML techs.

#### 5) report. 

For this we need varies of data visualization skills.


## 0. Experience

#### 1) Do researches on the topic, know the data by heart, use as much human knowledge as possible.

#### 2) Notice the outlier

#### 3) feature engineering is important

#### 4) use model ensemble

## 1, Instruction of the existing tools.

* Filename starts with 'learn_'.

There are scripts teaching you how to use data analysis and visualization tools like pandas, matplotlib, pyecharts...  This part contains the tutorial material I made as well as some resource on the internet.

## 2, The dummy project I did.

* Filename starts with 'proj_'.

Those projects are either made-up projects or the project owned by me. It is the demonstration of how to use those tools in practical cases. 

> Most of the py file cannot be complied correctly because I haven't provided the data file.

## 3, The new tools I made.

* Filename starts with 'DAT_'.

Those data-analysis tools are designed based on existed tools. I use them to simplify some task during the data analysis process.

> The DATs based on pandas are predecessors of library Bamboo, which is currently not published useful data-analysis tool.

> Project Athena will need some classes and functions from this repository.

# Project Athena: 
AI-based automotive data analysis tool which acts like an experienced data scientist, tells you important facts in the dataframe, interact with you to make conclusions and predictions.
